Growing

==============================================================================*/

grow a tree
grow a sphere
grow a tower
	blocks bouncing from side to side
	have to press button when it lines up
	better score for closer alignment
	combo points if you don't let it hit wall twice or three times
	secondary action shoots

enemy is growing and you must stop it

grow up
grow down
grow right
grow left

growing numbers
	arrange two panels to create the sum on the right


/*==============================================================================

Two Button Controls

==============================================================================*/

two arrows keys
right click and left click
mousemove plus two button controls
two rendered buttons to click on screen


two keys / two mouse buttons
	each controls an action on half of the screen
	they can both be similar actions the same/differing environment
	or they can continue to change and get harder
	can swap from top/bot to left/right, or always be a rotating view point in a square or circle
	maybe stay left and right so that you don't lose context of what you're controlling


hit button for trigger
or hold button for lift or sustained control

use button not in a boolean way
but use it to switch between 3 states
3 x 2 = 6

switch between four directions


direction/jump
direction/shoot
jump/shoot

double endless runner

1. toggle selection of something, turret
2. hold down to rotate turret


1. jump
2. toggle/size
use this to fit through cracks or eat enemies

GAME 1 - Double Tower Grower Avoider

==============================================================================*/

GENERAL
	as obstacle passes you, it stops on the other side of the map and build up
	build up to 1/3 or 1/2 on both sides to finish "growing" and beat the level
	each side has three lives?
	three lanes or 5 lanes, left goes left direction, right goes right direction
	stagger blocks on either side, or in sync? or both?
	use easing for char movement and block dropping?
	after beating a level, drop all blocks down, change color?
	make characters bobbing up and down, rotating? interesting movement in some way
	
CONTROLS
	A/D, left/right, mouse left/mouse right, maybe other bindings
	left movement moves left hero to the left
		when hitting the wall, wrap to other side? or reverse direction? Or swap direction?
	right movement moves right hero to the right
			when hitting the wall, wrap to other side? or reverse direction? Or swap direction?

GAMEPLAY
	how is it scored?
		timed and one death just light super hexagon?
		or just simple brick count?
		many lives?
		or par based, least amount of mistakes (hit by block, missed baddie)
	difficulty and color change after building up to halfway point
		how can difficulty ramp up?
			faster blocks?
			build higher?
			more columns?
			faster, stronger baddies?
			different perspective?
				move to top of level, then bottom, then top, etc.
	the main objective is the avoidance of the blocks
	but there should be a secondary one where you have to stay underneath something to destroy it
	these baddies can be separated from, or mixed with the normal flow
	maybe make them a lot slower, but take more time to kill
	can't let any through

STATES
	menu
	play
	gameover

LEVELS
	one progressive level, with breaks/changes one tower reaches halfway, or?
	experiment with more columns, are more columns harder or easier?
		might have to ramp other properties up to match number of cols

	distinct levels
		1 - 2 col | 0 baddies    | 3 tall  | faster | less delay
		2 - 2 col | 0 baddies    | 4 tall  | faster | less delay
		3 - 3 col | some baddies | 4 tall  | faster | less delay
		4 - 3 col | some baddies | 6 tall  | faster | less delay
		5 - 4 col | more baddies | 6 tall  | faster | less delay
		6 - 4 col | more baddies | 12 tall | faster | less delay
		7 - 5 col | most baddies | 12 tall | fastest | least delay
		8 - 5 col | most baddies | 24 tall | fastest | least delay

	distinct levels - for alternate model 2, faster and smaller delay on each level up
		1 - 2 col | 3 tall  | 
		2 - 2 col | 4 tall  | 
		3 - 3 col | 4 tall  | 
		4 - 3 col | 6 tall  | 
		5 - 4 col | 6 tall  | 
		6 - 4 col | 12 tall | 
		7 - 5 col | 12 tall | 
		8 - 5 col | 16 tall | 

AUDIO

POLISH
	debris or light particles falling down
	play with light beams on bricks
	overlay over whole game
	dust when blocks hit
	movement trails for heros and blocks
	screenshake
	make bricks complementary color of level to stand out more?
	light up current path subtly?
	snap to larger mode if screen estate is available
	is it a city, with clouds and a sun?
	is it in space, with planets and stars?
	is it underwanter, with bubbles, and stoof?

ALTERNATE MODEL 1
	left and right are actually left and right
	stop moving to shoot
	hold down both for another ability
	one char

ALTERNATE MODEL 2
	still two chars with same move mechanic
	instead, left character does all the dodging
	instead, right character does all the shooting
	right is kind of like an alternate dimension, ghost mode
	as the bricks land and are added on the left, they are mirrored and appear on the right
