/*==============================================================================

Twin Condition

==============================================================================*/

GENERAL
	stagger blocks/enemies on either side, or in sync? or both?
	use easing for char movement and block dropping?
	
CONTROLS
	A/D, left/right, mouse left/mouse right, maybe other bindings
	left movement moves left hero to the left
		when hitting the wall, reverse direction
	vice versa for right character

GAMEPLAY
	par based, least amount of mistakes (hit by block, missed baddie)
	maybe make them a lot slower, but take more time to kill
	right is kind of like an alternate dimension, ghost mode
	as the bricks land and are added on the left, they are mirrored and appear on the right
	maybe only check for collision if the hero is not moving, since they have to slide across a bunch to get back

LEVELS
	experiment with more columns, are more columns harder or easier?

	2 - 2 col | 4 tall  | 1 hit kills
	3 - 3 col | 4 tall  | 2 hit kills
	4 - 3 col | 6 tall  | 2 hit kills
	5 - 4 col | 6 tall  | 3 hit kills
	6 - 4 col | 12 tall | 3 hit kills
	7 - 5 col | 12 tall | 4 hit kills
	8 - 5 col | 16 tall | 4 hit kills
